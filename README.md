# TUM Tech Challenge WS18_19 | Team AzTech - Woodonic | MakerSpace Challenge

This repository consists of following files:
- Unsupervised Audio Anomaly Detection with Gaussian Mixture Model  => Code for developing Machine Learning Solution
- Training ML for Raspberry PI.ipynb => Code for preparing Machine Learning Model for Raspberry Pi
- Raspberry_Pi_code.py => Code thats meant to be run inside Raspberry Pi, loads trained model and processes audio signals
- WOODONIC.pdf => Technical Documentation
- saved_models/ folder => Contains trained Machine Learning Folders


Additionally, you can find audio recording dataset and 3D design of the prototype in the following link (not uploaded here due to GitHub filesize limits):
